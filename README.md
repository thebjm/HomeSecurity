Raspberry Pi Face Recognition Door using Python, wiith User Interface using Flask.
A face recognition system is a computer application for automatically identifying or verifying a person from a digital image source. One of the ways to do this is by comparing selected facial features from the image and a facial database. The main objective of the project is to make the house only accessible when your face is recognized by the recognition algorithms from OpenCV library and meanwhile you are allowed in by the house owner, who could maintain the entrance access and in case of unauthorized access to the house can be start an alarm and meanwhile inform the owner of house via e-mail.
Using OpenFace Library.

Hardware Used:
  1. Raspberry Pi 3 Model B
  2. 5MP Pi Camera Module
  3. Towerpro SG90 Servo Motor
  4. PIR Motion Detector Sensor Module
  5. Bread board
  6. Jumper wire
  7. 2 channel 5v relay module
  8. Buzzer
